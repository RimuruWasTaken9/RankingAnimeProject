Choose from a menu of how to rank all the anime I have watched as well as the option to save the ranking.
The saved file will be in the same folder as the program. 

The options are:

0 - exit program  
1 - rank all anime I have watched (around 190), in a list  
2 - rank 32 of the anime I've watched in a list  
3 - put all of the anime into a tournament-style elimination  
4 - put 32 of the anime into a tournament-style elimination  
5 - save the next program that is run  

in options 1 & 2, if you made a mistake you can fix and edit the list by typing "edit"
if you want to exit the program immediately even in the middle of a ranking, enter "0"

rankingAnime.py is the file you need to run, smalltournament is just a module.
Any tips on shortening or simplifying the code are welcome, as well as any ideas on what else to add.
